AWS recommends that you define a robust and consistent tagging strategy to enable better auditing, cost, and access control for your AWS resources. 
The AWS Terraform provider v3.38.0+ allows you to add default tags to all resources that the provider creates, making it easier to implement a consistent tagging strategy for all of the AWS resources you manage with Terraform.

In this tutorial, you will configure a set of default tags for your AWS resources. 
Then, you will override those tags for a specific resource. 
You will also learn how to use the default tags configuration to manage Auto Scaling group tags.
