The Terraform IaC is used to create three VPCs in an account to deploy and configure the app workloads for the respective environments, such as dev, staging, and prod.

Here, this mainly happens using the for_each meta-argument concept.

Here's the folder structure:
.
├── main.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── providers.tf
├── terraform.tfvars
└── variables.tf
1 directory, 5 files

How do I fork this code and make use of it?

a) Clone the repository to your local machine or wherever you want to store the code
   git clone https://github.com/thangacodes/project_usecase.git
   cd project_usecase/aws_terraform/for_each_concepts/vpc_subnet_ec2/
b) Run terraform commands like: init, validate, plan, apply and destroy
c) Finally, log in to the AWS console and check if the resources have been provisioned.
