There are terraform script files and bash script files in this folder, the purpose of this project is to setup MySQL database using an RDS instance.

With the "apply_tf.sh" script, a secret is created for the RDS instance using the SecretsManager service using a password of '20' characters using Python command with the help of "secret_create.sh" script.

Basically, it's like calling a bash script from within a script and doing multiple things at the same time.

Usage:-
=======

1) Clone this repository, go to the folder, and run apply_tf.sh, which does all the work for you, after which you connect to the RDS_instance endpoint using MySQL client software installed on Mac/Linux/Windows operating systems.
   $ git clone https://github.com/thangacodes/project_usecase.git
   $ cd project_usecase/aws_terraform/rds_secret_setup/
   $ ls -ltr
   $ sh apply_tf.sh     # You must provide input values wherever it asks you to do so during runtime of the apply_tf.sh script

2) Upon successful execution of the bash/terraform script, you will get the output values in terraform. Take the endpoint and connect the MySQL database using the MySQL client software on your computer.

3) If you receive any error when connecting to the database from your system, you need to add your system IP, in this case public IP/32, to the RDS instance security group.
    https://whatismyipaddress.com/ (example public ip is: 49.206.120.60/32)

4) You can retrieve and use the Database master password from the SecretsManager secrets tab
